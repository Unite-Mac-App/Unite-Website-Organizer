Unite is a professional-grade **website organizer and application builder** that revolutionizes how you interact with web services. By transforming websites into independent desktop applications, it provides a focused and integrated computing experience. This approach significantly enhances productivity and reduces distractions commonly associated with traditional web browsers.

The core functionality of Unite lies in its ability to create a dedicated window for any web address, stripping away the unnecessary browser interface elements like tabs, bookmarks, and address bars. This results in a clean, app-like environment tailored for specific tasks. Each generated application can be fully customized with its own icon, name, and specific settings, allowing for a high degree of personalization and organization.

Beyond basic wrapping, Unite offers advanced features such as notification support, ensuring you stay updated without keeping a browser tab open. It seamlessly integrates with the macOS ecosystem, supporting Dark Mode and appearing in the Application Switcher (Cmd+Tab) as a distinct program. Whether you are a professional managing multiple web-based tools or a student organizing research and communication platforms, Unite brings order and efficiency to your digital life. It is the perfect solution for decluttering your workspace and treating essential websites with the importance of native software.
